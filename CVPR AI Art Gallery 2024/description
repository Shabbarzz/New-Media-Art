Identity Trouble [Arabic: Haweih] is part of my ongoing exploration into constructing my genealogical journey using two different voices: my own and an AI ‘narrator’.    
      Identity is a tricky concept to discuss and define within its philosophical, social, anthropological, psychological, and logical context; its multiple connotations and the reasons for its inflation in respect to the one himself/herself, to the extent that there are large issues hidden under the cloak of what has come to be known as the "identity". I find myself going with the theoretical views of Azmi Bishara, a prominent Arab writer and scholar, who argued that the issue of the individual's self and social identity is a modern issue, which arose with the emergence of the individual who is able to think of their continuous "self", despite the transformations and changes in the course of their life. Bishara seeks to separate the concept of identity from other concepts such as cultural or civilizational character, political sectarianism, religious faith and oppression. My private position is a little more complex. Growing up as a Syrian was perhaps a vague process I never decoded, making this question an irksome task as it does not hold a direct simultaneous answer—at least for me. Oddly, the pertinence we create from the very young age—as Syrians, and as Eastern individuals—seems very attached to a different and wide range of cultural, political, and sociological discourse and spectrums, both from the inside and outside. For this indeed, I could not have any clear vision of what belonging is, nor have I had any perceptions of myself as a woman with a home to belong to. I was, surly, with no belonging. And while I grew up I could, generally speaking —as we all did—notice the gap and the convoluted relationship between "us" and" them", between the East and the West. Therefore, the meaning I created about myself as a Syrian was utterly absent as a young woman, deconstructed and built completely year after year, and perhaps was overlapped as the conflict started in 2011. Since then, I realized that my identity as a Syrian was somehow already verbatim stolen. And since then, I was shifted by Edward Said's views of identity out-layered in his book "Orientalism" [2], which-albeit being a socio-political study of the East and the West, it could indeed give me a better intuition to understand the bigger picture and to find my own meaning of being Syrian, and eventually to formalize my own concept of belonging. And after all, what does being Syrian mean to me? It means being a part of the political and the cultural system; a tiny part of history was and being made by a wide, tremendous cultural entities, that collided with each other. It means to live, to fight, to survive; to value every moment in a country where death is always nearby. This meaning, after all, shapes my identity as a Syrian; a free one.                                                                                                                                                                                                         As soon as the conflict started in 2011, my life as a Syrian teenager shifted to a more radical shape of uncertainty. And soon after the conflict continued to escalate, shattering the country apart, it was perhaps inevitable to enter the post-war trauma, even as young as the age of 13. The war could, extraneously, enable me to realize death, to form my own concept of it, to fear it, and to live with that fear year after year of the war. This was and is, perhaps, the most tremendous effect I have endured, shaping me until today as who I am.

Identity Trouble symbolizes those AI failures and the frustrations I felt during the Syrian war, and the lack of native localized self-expression. Using U-2 Net, an image segmentation model that partitions a digital image into multiple segments, I erased parts of my self-created portrait, creating an “absent” dataset. I then trained StyleGAN2, a generative AI model on this new dataset, outputting images signifying the eradication of her identity’s collective memory.
